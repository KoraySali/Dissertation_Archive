This Github repository will be linked to Google Colaboratory, Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm for the creation of a neural network for image detection of wildfires.


# Website goal
``The model will utilise a webpage for high-altitude imagery to identify fire with the hops of pin point the object in the image.``

# External Camera use
``The model will also utilise external cameras to take input images and identify any possible fire or smoke in the images in order to leverage the exisiting low-tech CCTV surveillance systems in place.``

# Main Findings
The main finding of this investigation was our CNN-SVM ensemble produced an accuracy of 95% across 2,400 test images. The pre-existing CNN architectures used were mostly high performing, some even achieving well over 99% accuracy.
